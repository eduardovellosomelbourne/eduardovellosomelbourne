    <main class="ev-page-content">


      <p class="large-paragraph">I am a creative technologist working as a Senior Lecturer and Researcher at the University of Melbourne. My practice and research focus on interaction design for emerging technologies. I am interested in the novel user experiences that are enabled by the combination of novel input and sensing modalities, the design of new interaction devices and techniques, and the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in interactive systems.</p>
      <p class="large-paragraph">I hold a PhD in Computer Science from Lancaster University (UK) and Bachelor in Computer Engineering from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Though my background is technical, my research is interdisciplinary, combining aspects of Engineering, Design, and Psychology.</p>
      <p class="large-paragraph">My work has been widely covered by the media in outlets such as New Scientist, the BBC, and Wired and has received Best Paper Awards at the most prestigious venues in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, including at CHI, UIST, TOCHI, and TEI.</p>
